# LibMonoSLAM

## Introduction:

This project aims to implement SLAM using the input from a single Monocular camera. 

There are plenty of different algorithms for MonoSLAM. The basic framework for this particular implementation is inspired by [MonoSLAM: Real-Time Single Camera SLAM](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~lav/Papers/davison_etal_pami2007/davison_etal_pami2007.pdf). However, this is not an exact replica of the framework proposed in that research work.
