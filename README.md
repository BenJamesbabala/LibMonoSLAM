# LibMonoSLAM

## Introduction:

This project aims to implement SLAM using the input from a single Monocular camera. 

There are plenty of different algorithms for MonoSLAM. The basic framework for this particular implementation is inspired by [MonoSLAM: Real-Time Single Camera SLAM](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~lav/Papers/davison_etal_pami2007/davison_etal_pami2007.pdf). However, this is not an exact replica of the framework proposed in that research work.

## How to run this code:

### Environment Setup:

#### You are going to need - 

1. Python 2.7.9 
2. Some IDE for Python, preferably [Spyder IDE](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/). 
  In Windows environment, Spyder is already included in [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/)
  For Mac and Linux, please consult the documentation
3. OpenCV needs to be installed and linked with Python in your system. Here are some useful links for that:

* [OpenCV-Python interface in Windows](http://opencvpython.blogspot.sg/2012/05/install-opencv-in-windows-for-python.html)
* [Setting up OpenCV with Python support in Mac OSX](https://jjyap.wordpress.com/2014/05/24/installing-opencv-2-4-9-on-mac-osx-with-python-support/)
* [OpenCV installation for Python in Ubuntu](https://www.raben.com/content/opencv-installation-ubuntu-1204)
* [Python bindings for OpenCV in Debian](https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/python/python-opencv)


#### How to run - 

Download the code and open it up in Spyder (or anything else). Fire up the *Driver.py* module.
